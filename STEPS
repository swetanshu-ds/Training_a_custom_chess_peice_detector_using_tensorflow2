1. Make a folder directly in google drive as TFOD2.x
2. You can choose any name but make sure to remember the name
3. Now make a colab notebook in the TFOD2.x folder and go to the link
4. https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/colab_tutorials/object_detection_tutorial.ipynb\
5. Write these commands as shown below one by one 
6. %cd /content/drive/MyDrive/TFOD2.x
7. !pip install -U --pre tensorflow=="2.*"
8. !pip install tf_slim
9. !pip install pycocotools
10. 
    import os
    import pathlib


    if "models" in pathlib.Path.cwd().parts:
      while "models" in pathlib.Path.cwd().parts:
        os.chdir('..')
    elif not pathlib.Path('models').exists():
      !git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tensorflow/models
      
      
11. 
    %%bash
    cd models/research/
    protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.


12. 

    %cd models/research
    !cp /content/drive/MyDrive/TFOD2.x/models/research/object_detection/packages/tf2/setup.py .
    !pip install .

13. 

import numpy as np
import os
import six.moves.urllib as urllib
import sys
import tarfile
import tensorflow as tf
import zipfile

from collections import defaultdict
from io import StringIO
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
from IPython.display import display



14. 
from object_detection.utils import ops as utils_ops
from object_detection.utils import label_map_util
from object_detection.utils import visualization_utils as vis_util
# THis is used to check whether all the object_detection library are working properly or not

15. 

# patch tf1 into `utils.ops`
utils_ops.tf = tf.compat.v1

# Patch the location of gfile
tf.gfile = tf.io.gfile

16. Now transfer or copy the dataset from the chess_dataset folder to the model-> research-> object_detection

17. Before sending the chess_dataset.zip to model-> research-> object_detection ,first make sure you download the data in your 
                                                         local system and then extract it ,then only send the the data


18.   Till here our Preparing the dataset for training is done.

19.  Go to the github website 
        https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md

20. Choose any model 
21.  For example we have choosed here this modes 
        http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz
        
22.  Now we have to clone this model into our object_detection
23.  First change the path
24. use this  %cd /content/drive/MyDrive/TFOD2.x/models/research/object_detection
25.  Now use= ===

  !wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz
  
  26. Since it was a tar file ,so we need  to un- tar it ,means unzip it.
  27. For untar - use
  
        !tar -xvf ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz
